				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While many people have been fixated on the on-going events surrounding Donald Trump and Kim Jun Un over the past few weeks. Some legislation enacted after the housing bust was quietly rolled back. While the new law signed by Trump does not do away with all the financial reforms, it does have some significant implications for home buyers.</p>
<p>The reforms put into place after the financial crises were intended to put an end to some of the reckless mortgage lending that transpired leading up to the financial collapse in 2008. However some of these rules have recently been deemed too strict and have made it difficult for some people to get loans. The newly signed law aims to ease access to credit by loosening up regulations on small and medium size banks.</p>
<p>Here are some items that home buyers should keep in mind:</p>
<p>First, the loosening of underwriting rules should make mortgages more plentiful and easier for some people who could not previously get mortgage to now qualify.</p>
<p>Second, the reform law encourages Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to explore alternative credit score models to help those with non-traditional credit files.</p>
<p>Finally, consumers are now able freeze and unfreeze their credit without charge, enabling borrowers to ensure that there are no surprises on their credit report leading up their need to obtain credit. Happy house hunting!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few weeks, mortgage rates have hit their highest levels since 2011. So is the era of low mortgage rates over?  Most likely, but the rates are still extremely low by historical standards. The increase in rates this year reflects a departure from a long period of declining rates that began during the financial crisis and bottomed out in late 2012.</p>
<p>The main reasons for the abrupt rise this year is a combination of a surging economy, wage increases and a steep rise in commodities such as gasoline which can stoke inflation worries.  A major concern for the economy is that these higher interest rates will begin to stop home owners from looking to trade up into large homes and thus stall some of the robust real estate market.</p>
<p>According to the National Association of Realtors, a 1% increase in mortgage rates can lead to a 7-8% reduction in home sales. That would be a huge economy bomb! This statistic can become even more acute due to the fact that people cannot simply opt for a less expensive home given the lack of inventory available in the market, especially at the more affordable tiers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With so many TV shows on about people making tons of money flipping houses, it is really hard to ignore. The temptation is great as it seems like such a great way to earn a living and seemingly have a nice balanced lifestyle. Well, as with everything it is never as easy as it looks and presents its own sorts of challenges. For the adventurous people out there, it could be a great side gig that could eventually lead into a full time career.</p>
<p>Before you go and just buy any house off the street, here are a few key things the experts suggest you keep in mind.  First, and I am sure you have heard this before “Location, Location, Location!”  These are the 3 fundamental rules of real estate and they hold true for flipping houses. Experts say to get the best bang for your buck, you should be looking to buy in the up-and-coming neighborhoods. Spend time driving the areas and find that spot that is right on the cusp of a nice area and not so nice area.</p>
<p>Once you do find the house in the perfect spot, make sure to negotiate a price that works in a profit margin. Depending on the type of project you will need to work in rehab and carrying costs to still ensure a profit by the time you are ready to turn around and sell the house.</p>
<p>Finally, make sure you have an exit strategy. Everything does not always go to plan and if you have not anticipated multiple ways to get out of the home you may be in for a rough ride. If the home does not sell right away you may need to wholesale the property or rent it out. Whatever happens you want to ensure you are prepared for the worst…But always hope for the best.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have all used the word millennial for some reason or another, but have we ever stopped to consider who the millennial really is?  For Baby Boomers, the term seems to be tossed around for pretty much anyone without gray hair who can be an easy target for a quick joke.  But this generation, who demographers typically classify as anyone born in the early 1980’s through the mid 1990’s are starting to make quite the splash in the real estate market.</p>
<p>According to the National Association of Realtors, Millennial&#8217;s were responsible for slightly more than a third of all home purchases made over the past year. And that makes them the most active generation of home buyers for the fifth year in a row.</p>
<p>Well the affordability issues still remain, and with the stubbornly low housing inventory and the lackluster amount of housing starts, the cost to buy a home continues to rise. Millennial&#8217;s on average from 2017 to 2018 purchased the same size home (1,800 square feet) for a higher price and more have said this year, that saving for a down payment was the most difficult part of buying a home.</p>
<p>We can assume going forward, that without an easing of current home prices, the task of buying a home for young adults will continue to be a difficult one.</p>
